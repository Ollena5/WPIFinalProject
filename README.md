# WPIFinalProject

## Non-Functional Requirements (15%)
The site must use:
1. (5%)valid and semantically appropriate HTML 5 and CSS Layout. Proof of
validation is required and must be inserted in the template file. Quality to
code and use of semantic tags is imperative.
2. (2%)proper and consistent navigation across the pages
3. (2%) any necessary image of your choice
4. (2%) proper color choice that adheres to the Human-Computer Interface
(HCI) principles
5. (2%) a nice and efficient layout of the elements in the page that adheres to
the Human-Computer Interface (HCI) principles. The Bootstrap CSS
Framework (http://getbootstrap.com/) is encouraged (and it will boost your
3
project grade by 5 points) but is not required. If you use Bootstrap, any
additional non-Bootstrap CSS must be contained within a single additional
CSS file.
6. (2%) JavaScript.

## Functional Requirements
The site must:
Correct positioning after Resizing (10%)
1. (10%) be responsive when resized and adapt both to a desktop as well as to
a phone device.
Other functional requirements (75%)
2. (5%) have a minimum of 5 pages in all (but can be more if you prefer). The
first page must be a “login page”. One page must contain the “history of your
store”, one page is for “getting a discount”. The others are of your choice.
3. (5%) advertise a minimum of 6 items in your store.
4. (10%) use JavaScript to login to the first page of your site. The login page
(beyond whatever you like to show) has two fields, one for the username, the
other for the password, plus the Login button. Suggest which password to
use to login and use JavaScript to verify the password. Send the page if the
password is correct to the welcome page of your site.
5. (5%) contain, in addition to images, at least one video or audio.
6. (10%) contain at least 1 table and a minimum of 2 different forms and 2
buttons in addition to a search field. Style the table using CSS.
7. (5%) contain at least one animation not required in other points of this list
(i.e. beyond the animated ad requested in #8) performed with advanced CSS
layout.
8. (5%) include 1 created by you “fake” ad per page (or more if preferred). The
same fake ad can be reused on another page. However, in the entire site,
there should be at least 3 distinct “fake” ads and at least one of the fake ads
must be animated. All the others can or cannot be. The animation can be very
simple.
9. (10%) use JavaScript in the “history of your store” page to automatically
scroll the text in an area. When the text is clicked, it scrolls the text, and when
it is clicked again the scrolling stops. If you prefer to insert this feature in
another page, that is fine as long as you use the feature in the site. (Hint: The
Wang’s book whose link is available in Canvas has info about scrolling)
10. (10%) contain a JavaScript code to count the words of each page. This option
must appear above the ad and, if desired, only in one page can replace the
“fake” ad of the page (this means that all of the pages except one, have both
the word count and the ad, and one may have both or only the word count).
4
11. (10%) have a “get your discount page” where the user can play a game to get
a special discount. These are the requirements of the game. The page shows
nine tiles. The user can click a tile to discover the discount hidden behind.
The tile flips when clicked and shows the earned discount. No more tiles can
be flipped after a discount is discovered. Decoration of the tiles and other
style of the page are left to you. If you have no clue on how to accomplish this,
you may watch any tutorial/video that teaches how to write the code for a
tic-tac-toe game or a memory game and make your modifications. If you do
so, please in the file you attach to your project insert the name of the
site/video tutorial where you got your inspiration and describe the
modifications you made. The discount page is similar to flipping tiles in a tictac-toe game or in a memory game. If I find out that you have taken code
from any place without referencing it, you will get a 0 on your final exam.
